# yt-downloaders
yt-downloaders is my answer to a simple little minimalist tool to use for downloading YouTube videos and Shorts with no hassle.

It utilizes [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for the API to fetch and download the videos whose URL is plugged into the tool's search bar.

## Installation
Download the release, then extract the executable `yt-downloaders.exe` somewhere and run it. Windows may require additional frameworks to be installed for it to work. yt-dlp is also required.

## Known problems
- VPNs may stop the tool from working, they are known to obstruct the way yt-dlp works its magic on YouTube's API. I would advise against using one when using this tool.
- yt-dlp may randomly stop working. Resetting your network might help. It might be YouTube, it might be yt-dlp, it might be your machine.
- The app may error out if used in unintentional ways. I hereby waive any and all responsibility and will not provide support if the app errors out. It works fine on my machine.
